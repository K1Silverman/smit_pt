Using:
* Java 17
* Spring boot 3.2.2
* Gradle
* Vue 3
* Sadly I am aware of some of the bugs, unhandled errors and some of the places are not as flexible and "a bit hard coded". Due to some planned events during the past weeks and illness that proceeded the event, I found myself short of time.
* I am happy to answer any questions about the code. I am reachable via e-mail: kurriksilver@gmail.com
